When our eyes view a scene, the left and right eyes see slightly different things. The left and right images are known as a stereo pair. By matching corresponding points in the two images, we are able to infer depth. The attached
paper http://www.bmva.org/bmvc/1992/bmvc-92-035.pdf proposes using a dynamic programming algorithm to perform stereo matching.
